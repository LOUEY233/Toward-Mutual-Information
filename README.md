# UDA-VAE++ for cardiac segmentation
This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation
of the paper: \
"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cardiac Segmentation: Towards Structure Mutual Information Maximization"

## Updates:
- 2022.4.21: Paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09334](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09334)
- 2022.4.21: Upload the code

## Prerequisites
* Windows or Linux
* CUDA 10.2, or CPU
* Python 3.6+
* Pytorch 1.2.0 (high pytorch version could decrease the results)
* torchvision
* SimpleITK
